<p>You can use the <code class="language-python">*</code> operator to repeat a certain collection multiple times, creating a new collection that contains the original repeated. This operation is valid for ordered collections like strings, lists and tuples. Here, we'll use lists and strings as an example.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<py-cell>print([0, 1] * 3)
equals_string="="
print(equals_string * 5)</py-cell>

<h2>Practical Uses</h2>

<p>String repetition is useful for creating patterns, separators, or formatting:</p>

<py-cell># Create a divider line
print("-" * 40)

# Create padding
spaces = " " * 10
print("|" + spaces + "centered" + spaces + "|")</py-cell>

<h2>Order Doesn't Matter</h2>

<p>You can place the number before or after the collection:</p>

<py-cell>print("!" * 5)
print(5 * "!")</py-cell>
